    <h4 class="text-muted" style="font-style: italic; opacity: 0.7;">Project Overview</h4>
    <p>
      The <strong>House Price Predictor</strong> is designed to estimate housing prices based on 
      critical features such as square footage, location, number of bedrooms, and amenities. 
      By leveraging machine learning models, the tool helps individuals, developers, 
      and investors make data-driven real estate decisions.

    <h4 class="text-muted" style="font-style: italic; opacity: 0.7;">Objectives</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide accurate and reliable housing price predictions.</li>
      <li>Support students, researchers, and professionals with accessible ML tools.</li>
      <li>Encourage transparency by making datasets and models openly available.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="text-muted" style="font-style: italic; opacity: 0.7;">Methodology</h4>
    <p>
      The predictor is powered by a regression-based machine learning pipeline. 
      The dataset was preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize numerical features, 
      and encode categorical variables. 
      After experimenting with multiple models, the final pipeline was optimized and saved 
      using <code>joblib</code> for deployment.
